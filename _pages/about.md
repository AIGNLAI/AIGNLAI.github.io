## About Me

I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, soon to pursue a masterâ€™s degree at Nanjing University. My research interests lie in open-world continual learning and federated learning, and I am part of the Cognitive Computing and Collective Intelligence Innovation Team at my university ([ccci.swufe.edu.cn](https://ccci.swufe.edu.cn/)). In this role, I explore cutting-edge approaches to machine learning and artificial intelligence.
